# unity-sliding-puzzle
A sliding puzzle game made with Unity 2022.3.4f1

## What is a sliding puzzle?
It's like a normal puzzle with square pieces, but every piece has to be in a valid position. There's one missing piece and you can move one of its neighbours' pieces into said missing piece position. The game ends when every available piece is in its correct position.

If you want an example of the game, [here it is](https://www.helpfulgames.com/subjects/brain-training/sliding-puzzle.html)!
